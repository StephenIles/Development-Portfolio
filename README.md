## About Me

Hi! I'm Stephen and I am currently studying towards my L5 Diploma in Web Application Development, looking to make a switch from my current job in warehousing to a career in Web Development. 

I have always had an interest in computers and coding since a young age, but for some reason I never made that leap to studying and pursue a career within the field. After becoming fed up within my current work enviroment I decided to go back and take that leap, studying full time around a full time job to be able to pursue a career in Web development.

## Skills

I want to break this up into a two sections as I do have a long list of languages and frameworks that I would like to start learning, but as there is so much out there I don't want to take on to much at the same time. 

### Current Skills

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** JQuery, Flask, Bootstrap, Materialize
- **Tools:** Git, Github, VS Code, Figma
- **Other:** Responsive Design, PostgreSQL


### Future Learning

- React
- Next.js
- dJango
- Tailwind CSS
- PHP
- MongoDB
- C#
- .Net

## Projects

### Project 1 - [One Life](https://github.com/StephenIles/OneLife-Milestone-Project-1-)

**Languages and Frameworks**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

This was my first independent build project for my Web Development course. The scopre for this project was to build a static website using HTML and CSS that was at least 3 pages.

The idea for this came from my personal hobbies where I enjoy spending time online with my friends using a program called Discord. Discord lets you build a chat room with multiple areas for different subjects and interested, Voice channels where people are able to hang out and interact with each other and so much more. 

I wanted to build a landing page for a Discord community for new users to be able to get a feel for the community before they commited to join and start interacting with the community. 

From personal exereince I know joining and leaving communities until you find one that you feel comforatable in and get along with users in that community can be a pain, so this was supposed to be an idea to help with that process.

Doing this project really gave me the opportunity to try and test ideas out that I had for the website, testing the capabilities of HTML and CSS and feeling confident in myself to be able to see a problem, and use online resources to find solutions and impliment them in projects. 


### Project 2 - [Cookie Clicker](https://github.com/StephenIles/Milestone-Project-2)

**Languages and Frameworks**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery

This was my second independent build project for my Web Development course. The scope for this project was to build an interactive website using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The idea for this project came from my love of games. I felt like a cookie clicker would really push my understanding of Javascript but at the same time it wouldn't be to much to take on to complete within the timeframe I had for this project. 

Initally I had planned this website to be multiple pages, but when I started building I felt that the user experience was better with this being 1 page with multiple sections. 

I wanted the user to be able to start by clicking a cookie to start gaining cookieds, as the user progresses they would then be able to buy upgrades which would then allow the user to get cookies automatically aswell as an increase in how many cookies they get per click. 

I really enjoyed working on this project as it let me dive into Bootstrap a lot more learning more about the grid system and how to implement it correctly. Also learning how to implement Javascript/jQuery into a website let me be more creative in how I would like things to work on a website. I allowed me to really see the potential of web development and have given me lots of ideas to implement into my own personal projects. 


### Project 3 - [Pokemon Vault](https://github.com/StephenIles/Milestone-Project-3-PokeCardTracker)

**Languages, Frameworks and Tools** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Figma

This is my third and current working project for my Web Development course. The scope for this project was to build a website where a user could manipluate a database with full CRUD funtionality. 

This idea came from my personal life where I do collect pokemon cards, so I fancied the challenge of creating a database of all the cards and collections, where I would also be able to track my collections and see which cards I am missing to be able to comeplete a collection.

I took a different approach to this project and completly laid the whole design out in Figma before I even touched any code. I did it this way to be able to start to get into the habit of understanding the design and layout before I start writing code hopefully reducing the amount of times I would have to rewrite parts becuase I didn't like to layout or how it looked etc. 

This is an on going project and you can check out the link above to see daily progress with this.
